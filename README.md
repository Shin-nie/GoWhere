# Error Handling Strategy
GoWhere employs a robust error-handling strategy using SwiJ's `Result` type to manage API-related issues, such as network failures and data parsing errors. When an error occurs, the app gracefully handles it by displaying user-friendly messages (e.g., "Failed to load country informa-on. Please try again later"), ensuring a seamless user experience. This strategy ensures that users are guided with clear informa-on, even when the app encounters connec-vity or server issues.
